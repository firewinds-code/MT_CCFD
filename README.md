Machine Training on Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to leverage advanced algorithms to develop a robust system for identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions in credit card transactions. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the project involves the analysis of historical transaction data on 2 domain : Time and Amount to train models capable of detecting anomalous patterns indicative of potential fraud. 
we balanced the data with various approach such as Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE and Adasy.
With every data balancing thechnique we built several models such as Logistic, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

we used train-test split.
